## üìã Prerequisites

### System Requirements

## üöÄ Local Development Setup

### 1. Clone the Repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/tryvinci/vinci-clips.git
cd vinci-clips
```

### 2. Install Dependencies
The project is split into a `backend` and a `frontend`, and you need to install the dependencies for both.

```bash
# Install backend dependencies
cd backend
npm install

# Install frontend dependencies
cd ../frontend
npm install
```

### 3. Configure Environment Variables
The backend requires an environment file to store your API key.

```bash
# Navigate to the backend directory
cd backend

# Copy the example .env file
cp .env.example .env
```

Now, open the newly created `.env` file in a text editor and add your Gemini API key:

```env
# .env
GEMINI_API_KEY=your-gemini-api-key-here
```

### 4. Start the Application
To run the app concurrently

**You first have to install concurrently**
```bash
# Start the frontend and the backend server
npm install concurrently --save-dev

#global installation
npm install -g concurrently
```

**In your first terminal (from the project root):**
```bash
npm start
```




You can also run the backend and frontend in separate terminal windows.

**In your first terminal (from the project root):**
```bash
npm run start:backend
```

**In your second terminal (from the project root):**
```bash
npm run start:frontend
```

Once both are running, you can access the application at `http://localhost:3000/upload`.
